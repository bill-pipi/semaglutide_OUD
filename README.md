Description
----------

**Figure1**  Risk of opioid overdose in patients with type 2 diabetes and opioid use disorders, comparing propensity-score matched semaglutide and other antidiabetic medications groups. Each eligible patient was followed from the index event until the occurrence of the outcome, death, loss to follow-up, or 1 year after the index event, whichever occurred first. Hazard rates were calculated using a Cox proportional hazards model, and cumulative instances were calculated using Kaplan-Meier Survival analysis, with censoring applied.  Overall risk = the number of patients with outcomes during the follow-up time window/number of patients in the cohort at the beginning of the time window. T2DM – Type 2 diabetes; OUD – Opioid use disorder; DPP-4i – Dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors; SGLT2i – Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors; SU – Sulfonylureas, TZD –  Thiazolidinediones. Other GLP-1RAs include albiglutide, dulaglutide, exenatide, liraglutide, and lixisenatide.

**Supplement_Results.pdf**  The file contaisn additional data and results for this study, which include (1) 5 tables showing characteristics of the semaglutide vs antidiabetic medication groups (metformin, DPP-4i, SGLT2i, SU, TZD and other GLP-1RAs) before and after propensity-score matching for baseline covariates for the study population of patients with comorbid T2DM and OUD (Supplement Results Table 1-5),(2)  one figure with 9 sub-figures showing cumulative incidence curves of matched semaglutide vs antidiabetic medication groups (insulin, metformin, DPP-4i, SGLT2i, SU, TZD,  other GLP-1RAs, liraglutide, dulaglutide) (Supplement Results FIgure 1), and (3) Comparison of risk and hazard rate of negative control outcome in patients with comorbid T2DM and OUD between propensity-score matched semaglutide and other anti-diabetes medications groups (Supplement Results FIgure 2).
