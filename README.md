Description
----------

**Figure 2a ** (A) Forest plots for hazard ratio and risk differences comparing propensity-score matched semaglutide and other antidiabetic medications groups in patients with comorbid T2DM and OUD. Each eligible patient was followed from the index event until the occurrence of the outcome, death, loss to follow-up, or 1 year after the index event, whichever occurred first. Hazard rates were calculated using a Cox proportional hazards model, and cumulative instances were calculated using Kaplan-Meier Survival analysis, with censoring applied.  Overall risk = the number of patients with outcomes during the follow-up time window/number of patients in the cohort at the beginning of the time window. T2DM – Type 2 diabetes; OUD – Opioid use disorder; DPP-4i – Dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors; SGLT2i – Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors; SU – Sulfonylureas, TZD –  Thiazolidinediones. Other GLP-1RAs include albiglutide, dulaglutide, exenatide, liraglutide, and lixisenatide.
