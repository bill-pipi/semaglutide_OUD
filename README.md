Description
----------

**Figure 2a ** Comparison of risk and hazard rate of opioid overdose in patients with comorbid T2DM and OUD between propensity-score matched semaglutide and other anti-diabetes medications groups. Outcomes were followed for 1 year after the index event for both exposure and comparison groups. Hazard rates were calculated using a Cox proportional hazards model with censoring applied.  Overall risk = the number of patients with outcomes during the follow-up time window/number of patients in the cohort at the beginning of the time window. DPP-4i denotes dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 inhibitors; SGLT2i, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors, SU, sulfonylureas, TZD, and thiazolidinediones. Other anti-diabetes GLP-1RAs included albiglutide, dulaglutide, exenatide, liraglutide, and lixisenatide.
